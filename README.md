# simple
A simple TODO service built with minimal dependencies

# Goals
The goal of this project is to build a simple microservice with as few external dependencies as possible. As
the project needs new features, I'll be implementing them utilizing only the standard library (within reason).

There will be three interfaces into the service:
1. HTTP through RESTful endpoints.
2. gRPC.
3. CLI - utilizing gRPC as a delivery channel.
